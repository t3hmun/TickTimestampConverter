Ticks to Timestamp Converter
============================

Some of my work uses .net `DateTime.Now.Ticks` as a way of making unique file names for data recordings (and storing the time of recording).

This program converts from ticks to human readable date time numbers.

A trivial GUI app meant for use by people who don't code.
